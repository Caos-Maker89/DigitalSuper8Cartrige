# DigitalSuper8Cartrige
This repo contains a project to create a digital super 8 cartridge, compatible with most super 8 cameras, inspired by other abandoned projects and improved.
The idea is to provide what is necessary to create a super 8 digital cartridge, to obtain videos with the same retro style, reviving real easily recoverable super 8 cameras.

# How it start?
I found some 35 mm cameras in my parents' old room with which I started shooting. Subsequently, I found two super 8 cameras in a flea market (for free), I looked at similar projects on the internet but I didn't find anything really complete. I decided to do my part to revive these cameras instead of keeping them shut down, given the monetary cost of real super 8 tapes and their development.

# Scope
- Give a precise tutorial for who want to create a super8 digital cartrige
- Improve the previous project including new features
- Give a final product for who want to directly buy it instead of build it

# Key Functions and features
- record always OR auto start recorded, based on a IR motion sensor that check the movement of the actual camera
- button with release to switch between color - b&w - sephia
- button with release to switch between slow motion / 18 / 24 fps
- button without release to switch between record always or record by motion sensor
- play a sound with the buzzer when the record start and stop when the cartrige is on motion sensore mode
- button with release to turn it on and off
- display that show the actual setting 

# Other features
- easy to insert and extract it from the camera
- easy to extract the video files to the computer
- it's a tiny power bank!

# Tier
I have an idea to make 3 different version of the camera:
- *lite*
    - no display
    - no fps selection (default 24)
    - no color switch 
- *medium*
    - no display
    - fps selection with buzz
    - color switch with buzz
- *complete*
    - display with some info
    - color switch with display info
    - fps selection with display info

# Problem and solution (if founded)

| Problem | Solution |
| ------- | ------- |
| Ir movement can be triggered when the cartdrige is put into the camera and removed | put the switch on/off in a position easy reachable before remove and after insert the cartrige. Make different version with different on of button position |

# Future features 
- shutter synch
- wireless microphone

# Future project
- 35 mm cartdrige to convert 35mm camera to digital

# Todo
- [x] complete the product list
- [ ] create a 3D stl file with the shape off the super 8 where fill tech component
- [ ] build the first (hardware) prototype
- [ ] programming to obtain a video when the rasp be on
- [ ] programming to switch between b&w / color / sephia with a button
- [ ] programming to use the motion sensor 
- [ ] make a tutorial of how to build it
- [ ] make a tutorial of how to programm it
- [ ] make istruction of how to use it 
- [ ] make a printable pdf of how to use it
- [ ] create a Etsy / Ebay insertion where sell the complete product avoiding the build phase for newbye with raspberry and DIY
- [ ] move the istruction to github wiki

# Product List
The list is on Amazon just for better organization, but you can buy where you want. The same product exist in aliexpress and ebay.
