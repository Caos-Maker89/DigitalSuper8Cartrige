# DigitalSuper8Cartrige
This repository contains a project aimed at creating a digital Super 8 cartridge compatible with most Super 8 cameras. It draws inspiration from other abandoned projects while incorporating improvements. The objective is to provide the necessary components to create a digital Super 8 cartridge, enabling users to capture videos with a retro style, thereby reviving easily recoverable Super 8 cameras.

# How it started
I stumbled upon some 35mm cameras in my parents' old room, which sparked my interest in photography. Later, I discovered two Super 8 cameras at a flea market (for free). While exploring similar projects online, I found none that were comprehensive. Therefore, I decided to contribute to the revival of these cameras rather than leaving them dormant, especially considering the cost of real Super 8 tapes and their development.

# Scope
- Provide a detailed tutorial for creating a Super 8 digital cartridge.
- Enhance the previous project by incorporating new features.
- Offer a final product for those interested in purchasing rather than building it themselves.

# Key Functions and features
- Record continuously or automatically start recording based on an IR motion sensor that detects the camera's movement.
- Button with release to switch between color, black & white, and sepia modes.
- Button with release to switch between slow motion, 18, or 24 fps.
- Button without release to toggle between continuous recording and motion sensor-triggered recording.
- Buzzer emits a sound when recording starts and stops in motion sensor mode.
- Button with release for power on/off.
- Display indicates the current settings.

# Other features
- Easy insertion and removal from the camera.
- Simple extraction of video files to a computer.
- Functions as a tiny power bank.

# Tiers
I have an idea to make 3 different version of the camera:
- *lite*
    - no display
    - Default FPS (24)
    - no color switch 
- *medium*
    - no display
    - FPS selection with buzzer feedback
    - Color switch with buzzer feedback
- *ultra*
    - Display with information
    - color switch with display info
    - fps selection with display info
    - white balance selection with display info
    - exposure settings

# Problems and solutions (if found)

| Problem | Solution |
| ------- | ------- |
| IR movement may trigger when the cartridge is inserted or removed from the camera. | Place the "armed" button in a easily reachable position before removing and after inserting the cartridge. Create different versions with varied button positions. |

# Future features 
- shutter synch
- wireless microphone

# Future projects
- 35 mm cartdrige to convert 35mm camera to digital

# Button List 
- on/off
- armed / record (depends of motion sensor state)
- motion sensor on / off 
- fps selector
- color selector

# Development Board

# To-do
- [x] complete the product list
- [ ] create a 3D stl file with the shape off the super 8 where fill tech component
- [ ] build the first (hardware) prototype
- [ ] write task for the first tier on the trello board
- [ ] programming [(see the trello board)](https://trello.com/b/D6Kr3EAe/super8digitalcartdrige)
- [ ] make a tutorial of how to build it
- [ ] make a tutorial of how to programm it
- [ ] make istruction of how to use it 
- [ ] make a printable pdf of how to use it
- [ ] create a Etsy / Ebay insertion where sell the complete product avoiding the build phase for newbye with raspberry and DIY
- [ ] move the istruction to github wiki

# Product List
The list is on Amazon for better organization, but you can purchase from other platforms like AliExpress and eBay.
