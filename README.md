# DigitalSuper8Cartrige
This repo contains a project to create a digital super 8 cartridge, compatible with most super 8 cameras, inspired by other abandoned projects and improved.
The idea is to provide what is necessary to create a super 8 digital cartridge, to obtain videos with the same retro style, reviving real easily recoverable super 8 cameras.
